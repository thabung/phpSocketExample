Steps to run the test:
1. Save both files, client.php and server.php, in a folder in your local server running Apache and PHP.
2. From the command line, run the server.php program to listen for socket connections.
3. Open Google Chrome (dev build) and point to the client.php page
4. Done, your browser now has a full-duplex channel with the server.
 
Start sending commands to the server to get some responses.
